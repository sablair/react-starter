# React Starter

Quick way to start coding a React project using NodeJS
## Getting started
### Prerequisites
- Node version 5.10+
- npm 3.8.3+

### Additional instructions
Webpack is used for transpilation, as such, running the command webpack at the command prompt should be sufficient, ie:
```sh
$ webpack
```

In the event that an error such as 'command not found appears', try this command to install the component globally:
```sh
$ npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server
```
